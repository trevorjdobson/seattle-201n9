# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 5

Today in lab you will fork and clone a GitHub repo, and then create solutions to some code problems such that your solutions pass the included tests.

**The detailed lab instructions are inside app.js. Be sure to follow instructions CAREFULLY.**

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* Place no new function calls in your code, ***unless*** inside of another function. Everything should be run/tested by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
* Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into *master* on GitHub (and then pull back into master on your laptop!) when the problem is completed. Complete the problems in order, and do not move on to the next one until the current one is complete. Don't forget to immediately pull the updated master branch from GitHub into your local master branch ***each and every time*** you merge a pull request!
* Although this is an individual lab assignment, do feel free to (heck, it is *encouraged* that you) collaborate and work in pairs or groups.

The success of your code will be determined by whether it passes tests that are in the `tests.js` file. You do not need to do anything with `tests.js`, though you should definitely take a look at it to see how it works.

Submission instructions are in the Canvas assignment.

### Stretch Goal

After you complete all 5 problems and have all tests passing, try putting the content of the return messages into the DOM, using the `<p>` tags that follow the corresponding `<h2>` tags with the function name in them.
