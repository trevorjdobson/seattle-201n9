# Community Involvement

This course is a solid introduction to the technical skills that it takes to be a part of the web development world.
However, technical proficiency on its own won't make you a "great" programmer.
A large part of being a great programmer is being involved in your community.
As a junior developer, you become acquainted with some of the higher concepts and larger players in the local web dev community as well as in the global programming space.
As an intermediate developer, regular participation in things like meetups and conferences keep your name in circulation and keep your skills relevant as you learn about subjects outside of your job responsibilities.
As a senior developer, you get in touch with less-experienced developers in your field, nurturing the next generation of programmers.
Everyone wins when we get involved in the community, so we figure we should give you incentive to get out and join the fray.

## What's a Meetup?

Meetups take a couple of different flavors.
You've got your monthly-ish local area meetings, and you've got your more-regular programming nights.
At the monthly-ish meetings you'll see local programmers give short or long talks about whatever strikes their fancy.
You'll learn about new topics in the field, or get reinforced on some common problems that programmers face.
You'll even get fed and maybe a bit of booze to top it off.
Finally, and most importantly, it's your first real networking opportunity as a developer.
Concerned that you don't know enough or aren't skilled enough to "deserve" to be a part?
It's ok, meetups are oftentimes very welcoming to beginners!
It's a good time for most and entirely worth an evening or two.

The programming nights are as they sound: nights where folks get together after work and chisel away at some project.
Most people have things to work on, but that doesn't mean that they're not open for conversation or willing to give a little help!
Oftentimes the people that attend these programming nights go just so they can meet new developers and help them work through their programming problems.

## Where to Find/Which Ones to Attend?

[Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) is a great site for finding a local meetup, and there's a group for most sides of programming.
